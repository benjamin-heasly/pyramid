These Phy files came from the Phy documentation at https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting_user_guide/#datasets.
That page links to [small test dataset](https://codeload.github.com/kwikteam/phy-data/zip/master).
I (Ben H) accessed the dataset link on 11 October 2023 and copied some the contents of the contained "template" folder to in this repo.
I excluded files that we don't need for reading spike times by per cluster.
