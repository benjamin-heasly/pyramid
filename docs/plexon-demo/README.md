# Plexon Demo

Here's a demo / example of Pyramid with a Plexon `.plx` file.

## overview

This example will read from a Plexon `.plx` file on your machine.
Since `.plx` files can be large, you'll have to bring your own!
Note the path of the file you want to use, for example,

```
~/data/MrM/Raw/MM_2022_08_05_REC.plx
```

Pyramid will read several Plexon event, spike, and analog signal channels from the file.
It will use event data to delimit trials in time and assign events, spikes, and signals to each trial.
It will use standard, rule-based configuration as well as custom code to enhance each trial with additional name-value pairs.
Finally, it will use several standard plotters to visualize the trials as they come.

All of this is declared and configured in a Pyramid experiment YAML, [demo_experiment.yaml](demo_experiment.yaml).
This README will describe each section of the YAML along with links to relevant code and images. 

### experiment configuration graph

To start with, we can generate an overview graph of the experiment configuration.  Don't forget to `cd` to this folder!

```
cd pyramid/docs/plexon-demo

pyramid graph --graph-file images/demo_experiment.png --experiment demo_experiment.yaml --readers plexon_reader.plx_file=~/data/MrM/Raw/MM_2022_08_05_REC.plx --search-path ./config
```

`images/demo_experiment.png`
![Graph of Pyramid Reader and Trial configuration for a Plexon file.](images/demo_experiment.png "Overview of a Plexon experiment")

Note the `--search-path ./config` at the end of the command.
This lets Pyramid look in the nearby `./config` folder for files mentioned in `demo_experiment.yaml`, which helps us organize the demo.

The `--search-path` can point to any folder or list of folders on your machine, so it could help organize various shared and lab-specific code and config.
The default search path is in the user's home folder, `~/pyramd`.

## experiment YAML

The experiment YAML file [demo_experiment.yaml](demo_experiment.yaml) tells Pyramid how to read, process, and plot the data in our Plexon file.  Here's a look at each section.

### experiment: ###

The `experiment` section is just metadata about the experiment itself suitable for inclusion in an NWB file, and displayed in Pyramids BasicInfoPlotter, below.

```
experiment:
  # Basic info suitable for inclusion in an NWB file.
  experimenter:
    - Last, First M
    - Last, First Middle
  experiment_description: An test experiment.
  institution: University of Fiction
  lab: The Fiction Lab
  keywords:
    - fictional
    - test
```

### readers: ###

The `readers` section tells Pyramid to read a Plexon file, and which event, spike, and AD signal channels to take:

 - For `spikes` it will take `all` of the channels present in the file.
 - For `events` it will take only the `Strobed` channel and give it the name `ecodes`.  It will also make a separate copy the `ecodes` buffer, named `delimiter`.
 - For AD `signals` it will take only the channels named `X50` and `Y51` and give these the names `gaze_x` and `gaze_y`.  It will apply a gain of 10 to each signal to scale the voltage data into degrees visual angle.

            args:
              gain: 10
```

### trials: ###

The `trials` section tells Pyramid how to delimit trials in time based on raw event data, and how to build up each trial using rule-based configuration as well as custom code.

To delimit trials in time, Pyramid will look at the `delimiter` buffer.  Events with value `1005` will mark the boundary between trials, and events with value `1010` will mark the zero-time within each trial.

To build each trial Pyramid will use two standard, rule-based enhancers and two custom code enhancers.  All of the enchancers will add some name-value pairs to each trial, indicating things like events of interest, trial scores, saccades, etc.

 - A standard, rule-based [PairedCodesEnhancer](../../src/pyramid/trials/standard_enhancers.py) will look for numeric events that encode property-value pairs for each trial.  The names and encodings for these are declared in two tables, [config/main-ecode-rules.csv](./config/main-ecode-rules.csv) and [config/special-ecode-rules.csv](./config/special-ecode-rules.csv).
 - A standard, rule-based [EventTimesEnhancer](../../src/pyramid/trials/standard_enhancers.py) will look for named events of interest and record any occurrence times within each trial.  The names and encodings for these are declared in the same two tables, [config/main-ecode-rules.csv](config/main-ecode-rules.csv) and [config/special-ecode-rules.csv](config/special-ecode-rules.csv).
 - A standard [ExpressionEnhancer](../../src/pyramid/trials/standard_enhancers.py) will evaluate a given expression against each trial and add the result to each trial as `actual_task`, which will drive conditional enhancements below.
 - A standard [SignalSmoother](../../src/pyramid/trials/standard_adjusters.py) will apply Gaussian smoothing to gaze signal channels.
 - A standard [SaccadesEnhancer](../../src/pyramid/trials/standard_enhancers.py) will examine the `gaze_x` and `gaze_y` AD signals for each trial and extract saccades.  Each saccade will be a dictionary of saccade parameters like `t_start`, `x_end`, `y_end`, etc.  This will only run for trials `when` the value of `actual_task` is true, and at least one `fp_off` time is present.
 - Another [CustomEnhancer](https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/pyramid/blob/main/docs/plexon-demo/custom_enhancers.py#L25) will examine all of the trial data and enchancements above and compute experiment-specific labels, scores, etc.  The Python code for this is in the same file, [config/custom_enhancers.py](config/custom_enhancers.py).  This will only run for trials `when` the value of `actual_task` is true.

#### BasicInfoPlotter
The [BasicInfoPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows Pyramid's overall progress through the Plexon file along with static metadata about the experiment and subject.  It also has a `Quit` button -- _wow!_

![Pyramid BasicInfoPlotter with static and progress info and Quit button.](images/BasicInfoPlotter.png "Pyramid BasicInfoPlotter")

#### SignalChunksPlotter
The [SignalChunksPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows gaze signal traces over time, aligned to the zero-time for each trial.  The most recent trial is in full color, on top of 10 recent trials which are partially transparent.

![Pyramid SignalChunksPlotter with gaze signal data.](images/SignalChunksPlotter.png "Pyramid SignalChunksPlotter")

#### NumericEventsPlotter
The [NumericEventsPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows event times and raw numeric values for the `ecodes` buffer which came from the original Plexon `Strobed` channel.  The most recent trial is in full color, on top of 10 recent trials which are smaller and partially transparent.

![Pyramid NumericEventsPlotter for ecode event times and raw numeric values.](images/NumericEventsPlotter_ecodes.png "Pyramid NumericEventsPlotter for ecodes")

#### SpikeEventsPlotter
The [SpikeEventsPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows spike event times from all Plexon spike channels, with trial number on the vertical axis.  Only spikes assigned to Plexon unit 1 are shown and the Plexon channels are color-coded in the legend.

![Pyramid SpikeEventsPlotter for spike event times over trials.](images/SpikeEventsPlotter.png "Pyramid SpikeEventsPlotter")

#### EnhancementTimesPlotter
The [EnhancementTimesPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows the names and times for events of interest within each trial.  All trial enhancements that were placed into the `time` category are shown, including rule-based enhancements declared in [config/main-ecode-rules.csv](config/main-ecode-rules.csv) and [config/special-ecode-rules.csv](config/special-ecode-rules.csv) and custom enhancements created from [config/custom_enhancers.py](config/custom_enhancers.py).  The most recent trial is in full color, on top of 10 recent trials which are smaller and partially transparent.

![Pyramid EnhancementTimesPlotter for named events of interest within each trial.](images/EnhancementTimesPlotter.png "Pyramid EnhancementTimesPlotter")

#### EnhancementXYPlotter
The [EnhancementXYPlotter](../../src/pyramid/plotters/standard_plotters.py) shows 2D/XY values of interest from each trial.  Specific values to plot are declared by name:

 - `fp_x`/`fp_y`, `t1_x`/`t1_y`, and `t2_x`/`t2_y` are plotted as individual points
 - `scored_saccade` is plotted as a group of several points and shown as a line.  To show direction, the last point in the line gets a marker.

The most recent trial is in full color, on top of 10 recent trials which are smaller and partially transparent.

## running it

Here's how to run Pyramid in `gui` mode, which is how the plots shown above were created.

```
pyramid gui --trial-file demo_experiment.hdf5 --experiment demo_experiment.yaml --readers plexon_reader.plx_file=~/data/MrM/Raw/MM_2022_08_05_REC.plx --search-path ./config
```

This should open up a few figure windows, similar to the images above.
The plots should update every few seconds, as if replaying the original acquisition timeline (in `gui` mode Pyramid can simulate delay while reading from data files.)

To exit Pyramid, you can:
 - wait a long time for the replay to finish
 - close all the figure windows
 - `ctrl-c` or `kill` the Pyramid process
 - press the `Quit` button in the `BasicInfoPlotter`

If you're only interested in the trial file and not the gui, you can run Pyramid in `convert` mode.

```
pyramid convert --trial-file demo_experiment.hdf5 --experiment demo_experiment.yaml --readers plexon_reader.plx_file=~/data/MrM/Raw/MM_2022_08_05_REC.plx --search-path ./config
```

This won't plot anything, and will convert the Plexon file to a trial file as fast as it can.
