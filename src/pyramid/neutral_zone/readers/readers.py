     - Maintain internal state related to the data source, like a file handle and byte offset, a data block index,
       a socket descriptor, etc.
     - Implement read_next() to consume an increment of available data from the source, update internal state
       to reflect this, and return results as a dict of name - BufferData entries.
     - Implement __enter__() and __exit__() to confirm to Python's "context manager protocol"", which
       is how Pyramid manages acquisition and release of system and libarary resources.
       See: https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/#standard-terminology
     - Implement get_initial() to return a dictionary of name - BufferData entries, allowing users of the
       Reader to see the expected names and BufferData sub-types that the reader will produce.

    The focus of a reader implementation should be getting data out of the source incrementally and converting
    each increment into a dict of BufferData values.  From there, Pyramid takes the results of get_initial()
    and read_next() and handles how the data are copied into connected buffers, filtered and transformed into
    desired forms, and eventually assigned to trials.

        When comparing sync event times between readers the registry will use the latest sync information recorded so far.
        It will also try to line up times in pairs so that both times correspond to the same real-world sync event.

            reference: |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
            other:     |   |   |   |   |  |   |   |
                                                  ^^ latest pair seen so far, seems like a reasonable drift estimate

        The registry will form the pairs based on difference in time, as opposed just lining up array indexes.
        This should make the drift estimates robust in case readers record different numbers of sync events.
        For example, one reader might suddenly stop recording sync altogether.

            reference: |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
            other:     |   |   |
                                  ^ oops, sync from other dropped around here here!

        In this case, pairing up the latest events by array index would lead to "drift" estimates that grow
        in real time, and don't really reflect the underlying clock rates.

        So instead, the registry will consider the latest sync event time from each reader, and pair it with the closest
        event time from the other reader.  From these two "closest" pairs, it will choose the pair with the smallest
        time difference.
            reference: |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
            other:     |   |   |                   ^ "closest" from reference is huge and growing in real time!
                               ^ "closest" from other is older, but still looks reasonable

        All this assumes that clock drift is small compared to the interval between real-world sync events.  If that's
        true then looking for small differences between readers is a good way to discover which times go together.
