    We want pyramid GUI mode to be able to juggle several tasks at the same time:
     - checking for new reader data and delimited trials
     - updating plots for each new trial
     - responding to GUI user inputs like resizing figures or pressing buttons/widgets
     - responding to GUI window closing so we can exit

    So, things are asyncronous from both the trial data side and from the user interface side.
    This is manageable with matplotlib, but not automatic.
    Here's some reading that informed the approach used here:
     - https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/interactive_guide.html#explicitly-spinning-the-event-loop
     - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7557098/matplotlib-interactive-mode-determine-if-figure-window-is-still-displayed

    We'll expect the pyramid GUI runner to loop through these tasks.
    It will expect the data side to poll for data or block with a short timeout.
    This will allow us to interleave GUI updates and event processing as well.
    This class implements the GUI updates and event processing part.
